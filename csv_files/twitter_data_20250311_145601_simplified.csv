2,“人心是最大的政治。”社会工作是面向最广泛的社会领域、最广阔的基层组织、最广大的人民群众所开展的工作，只能加强，不能削弱。
2,总书记深刻指出：“做好社会工作是全党共同责任。”在党中央集中统一领导下，各级党委（党组）扛起政治责任、加强组织领导和统筹协调，各地各有关部门积极主动作为、高效协同联动，社会工作部门勇于探索实践、扎实履职尽责，必能形成做好社会工作的强大合力。
2,这只是他的一厢情愿。说得好听他这算中国历史上那些变法，说得难听就一个政治菜鸟啥也不懂在这瞎逼逼瞎指挥。只有一个理念，就敢随便乱搞，他不死谁死？他和老毛说要超英赶美大跃进有什么区别？老毛当年的初衷也是想让中国强大啊，毕竟中国强大了他才强大。天欲使其亡毕先使其狂！
2,阅兵是党内政治斗争的工具，#中共将军 就是盗国贼的 #保安❗️💰🐭💰
2,一方面要推动实现对新就业形态劳动者党组织常态化组建，不断提升党组织覆盖率；另一方面，要着眼新就业形态劳动者切实需求和急难愁盼，创新党建工作内容和方法，把思想政治引领同凝聚服务结合起来，加强党组织的凝聚力和向心力。
2,未来的政治meme币应专注于实际经济支持和长期可持续发展，而非单纯的短期获利。通过透明的政策和真正的创新，才能为社会创造价值，而不是简单的“割韭菜”。
2,这不是年轻人的问题，是整个现代教育系统的问题。已经大到无法忽视，必须面对和解决。重教条而轻义理，务虚而不务实，只讲政治正确却不教授沟通妥协的方法。
2,说的对，他的政治立场让特斯拉销量在欧洲也暴跌
2,政治生命周期 •“八年变化周期”：心理学和社会学研究表明，公众对领导人的支持度通常在 4至8年内 发生显著变化，长时间执政容易导致反感增加。 •“改革反作用”：每位领导人都会面临政策反作用，若长期执政，社会矛盾可能累积，最终难以调和。
2,适应与疲劳效应 •决策疲劳（Decision Fatigue）：长期高强度决策容易导致认知能力下降，影响执政质量。 •心理学中的“新鲜感法则”：公众倾向于对长期在位的领导人产生“政治疲劳”，渴望新面孔带来新政策。
2,共产党经济要崩溃，中共军队比俄罗斯还惨！ 国际政治、地缘政治、疫苗、病毒灾难，党內的人军队的人不相信习打台湾能贏。香港经济崩塌，国內银行、房地产及国有企业坐吃山空的危机即将爆发。 2022/10/13

2,【币币为你爆】🎙️Bitwise 首席投资官：为何比特币战略储备的意义被低估了 比特币唯一关键的问题在于：它会像黄金一样，成为具有地缘政治重要性的全球宏观资产吗？
2,马斯克参与政治做的事情只是他的一厢情愿。说得好听他这算中国历史上那些变法，说得难听就一个政治菜鸟啥也不懂在这瞎逼逼瞎指挥。只有一个理念，就敢随便乱搞，他不死谁死？他和老毛说要超英赶美大跃进有什么区别？老毛当年的初衷也是想让中国强大啊，毕竟中国强大了他才强大。天欲使其亡毕先使其狂！
2,那么老师到底了吗？你这论点有政治正确因素吗
2,这个人分析股票不考虑马斯克的政治行为给特斯拉带来的影响吗
2,除了吵架、黄诈、政治谣言、焦躁、愤怒、沮丧，简中X几乎提供不了太多有价值有意义的信息。 一个人长期浸润在这种环境里很难独善其身，更不要说积极向上了，最后别面目狰狞就烧高香了。 这就是我的切身体会。
1,中国男人的秉性就是这样，找女的结婚就是想要儿子，如果你生不出来我就找别人生，反正有的是女人，所以和中国男人在一起是没有爱情的，一肚子坏水，尤其这种反贼，深谙政治手段，根本搞不过他，一旦有了新的女人愿意给他操，他们会毫不犹豫把旧爱一脚踹了😂😂😂畜生不如
2,还有方脸的同伙：徐某人、李老师之流，这帮人就是在野共产党。还有悉尼奶爸这个政治投机分子，这个疫情期间公开支持雇主强制雇员疫苗的左逼开始自称保守派参加竞选了
2,🦁：你們如果有什麼想要推動的東西…去問任何人都行！ 所以他們搞這麼久的政治活動投票出來選出一個沒有要做事的人，結論就是🦁只贏得了約翰的稱號，還是沒有人可以當領頭人救命哈哈哈哈哈哈我肚子好痛🔗：謝謝大家的參與，我們下禮拜再見👟：我覺得我們應該讓🔗當總統👹：對他表現得比他們好多了

2,所以金融术语里有排毒期这种的专业术语吗？政治语言里有排毒期这种说法吗？
2,这哥们一买，销量更差！川普的支持者都是没钱没权，希望美国的伟大能给他们带来荣耀，能花钱买Tesla车支持Elon的真不多。Elon做为商人真不该掺合政治，也许他能在其他领域拿到更大利益，但现在是Tesla品牌会被很多中产抵制
2,是您理解有误吧。孙先生秉承的道统，是这四个字：天下为公。民族主义，是基于现实世界中，以民族国家为基本形式的政治现实而提出来的。没有民族意识，没有国族认同，外遭强国欺压，不能独立自主；内部天天打来骂去，无法和衷共济，哪里搞得起什么民主，谈何人民权利。
2,俄罗斯基于全球局势，对中国的经济、政治及军方做出判断，展现出其高超的政治谋略。普京调整策略，与美国恢复关系，确保能源市场的利益。中共以最贵的价格采购石油、天然气，让中国人民为其买单。中共挑战美国、推动“一带一路”和各种长期计划，最终会将中国带到地狱的边缘。 2020/11/28
2,我不了解Elon是怎麼想的，正如絕大多數人一樣。我反對的是他進入政治刻心方式，是讓人10分不安，及恐懼。他主動不收取工資，對於我們這樣的絕大多數平凡人來說是很大的犧牲，但大家都可以想像到對於他這種億萬富豪來說，他現在擁有的權力和影響力，比起他所獲得的工資來說不算什麼。
2,这只是他的一厢情愿。说得好听他这算中国历史上那些变法，说得难听就一个政治菜鸟啥也不懂在这瞎逼逼瞎指挥。只有一个理念，就敢随便乱搞，他不死谁死？他和老毛说要超英赶美大跃进有什么区别？老毛当年的初衷也是想让中国强大啊，毕竟中国强大了他才强大。天欲使其亡必先使其狂！
2,民進黨複製白色恐怖和228，對我全家和友人政治迫害。 極獨派、長老會、同流合污收黑錢的，你們全部該死！ 國民黨極統派也一樣，收了中華人民共和國多少錢？ 不是中華兒女要三民主義同一中國嗎？
2,奴才 滿洲故稱阿哈 即恩養從屬之人 滿洲舊制為八旗領主封建 奴才與中國之奴婢意義不同 他是一種政治地位 而非社會階層 他身份附屬在主家 類似於舊日本之家臣 其政治地位從屬主家而定 所謂有其奴必有其主 所以奴才無權為自己的政治意願負責 而必須傾向於主家的主張
2,这些肯定是很久以前的照片了. 没人会开特拉斯为了政治原因去换LOGO的. 不可能.
2,这样的规定令副总统在美国政府的行政和立法两个分支中都扮演了角色，但又不能参与日常的工作，再加上这两种情况出现的概率都极低，所以副总统的基本上没什么政治存在感，开国元勋之一的富兰克林给副总统起了一个很恰当的外号——“多余的阁下”。
2,川普出面，顶马斯克！ 他说Elon冒着生命危险 ， 在帮助美国走向再次伟大。 我也在拜读他的推文。 最近这几天，他的思想乱了，尤其是在泽连斯基白宫吵架后，马的推文暴露了他实际上不懂政治。 我担心，这将要让他付出更大的代价。
2,土改从来没有让农民获得政治地位之外的任何额外利益，反而是让人民互相杀害，政府坐收渔利。如果真的想提高农民的收入，何须杀人，只要立法限制地主的租金在合理的范围，降底粮食的税收。立好劳动法，农民自然有好日子过。
2,蔡慎坤的野心背后，隐藏着商人的逐利本质。他的转型是否只是为了更大的利益？我们需要的是一位真正为民众服务的领导者，而非一个利用政治谋取私利的商人。
2,边境安全不是武器化的政治问题，而是我们共同的责任。
2,希望川普4年任期结束前也给马斯克发一张赦免令，以免万一民主党再执政对他进行政治迫害。
2,如果牡特尔特真的有问题 早就应该被抓 非要在来中国香港之后被抓 无疑就是政治迫害 就是对中菲之间的政治挑拨离间 就是不怀好意之举
2,张军在报告中表示，2025年，人民法院要坚持以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，深入贯彻习近平法治思想和总体国家安全观，坚持党中央集中统一领导这个最高政治原则，
2,一定不会的，国内政治是严肃的，一般不会整些搞笑的东西出来
2,"也就是说借战败, 新日本完全甩掉了大量恶臭的历史包袱, 战前战后日本是从根上就完全不同的两个国家,甚至除了天皇以外没有任何继承性关系。 这就是美国给日本带来的优点。 一个事物有正面就有负面。 美国控制日本带来的负面就是政治政坛不独立，从而导致经济金融不独立这个问题就是美国想收割日本很容易"
2,🚨若您错过: 前  CEO  正在积极推动赦免申请，希望获得  的宽恕。然而，政治圈内人士认为，他在未经授权接受  采访并因此被单独监禁后，获赦的可能性微乎其微。
2,能避免打仗肯定不要走到那一步啊，可是随着岛内老一代的逝去进入政治舞台的都是经过绿党教育下的产物，真的和平统一的希望越来越渺茫了。之前台湾大选结束国内发言人还说大选结果不代表民心所向，这其实是有点自欺欺人的。。很多新生代台湾人心底早就不认同两岸是同胞了
2,非常可怕，我無論在發什麼貼文都會被這種AI粉狗騷擾，不管是不是跟政治有關的，都會被騷擾
2,美国政治制度失败，阶级矛盾尖锐，现在已经进入了丛林社会，不然不会有特狼普总桶!美国唯一的救赎就是解体联邦，否则就会内战。美国还没有倒下的原因就是美债还没有爆破，当那一天来临，美国就寿终正寑了!
2,为了自己的国家不被侵略他没有错！错就错在认贼作父，成了战争工具！始作俑者是谁？心里没点数吗？是谁在推波助澜？北欧东扩咋回事有几人不知道的？司机就是没有政治远见的小丑，就如同若干年前的戈尔巴乔夫！
2,皿煮没有什么完整不完整的说法，北欧只是经济上讲究大政府包办，社会分配公正优先于绩效和整体经济增长，政治体制上跟其他欧洲主流的议会制国家没什么区别。美国建国国父们非常讨厌皿煮这个概念，将它视为多数人的暴政，联邦宪法中从来一个字也没提过皿煮，替代一人一票普选的选举人团制度也是为此而生
2,也许我们可以问反美役者们把谁理解为她们的朋友，把谁理解为她们的敌人。现在看来她们显然更想和女企业家女领导们呆在一块儿，而不是和被强迫剪头发的跨女们、家庭主妇们和性工作者们站在一起。可这显然不是美役这个词必然导致的结果；或许它也可以导向完全不同的政治想象，而这需要我们先愿意这样想。
2,中国反马斯克？先不谈马斯克几乎没有任何反中国政府的言行（马斯克喷欧美各国就是不碰中国）FSD已经进入中国了，马斯克他妈长居上海，上海有最大的特斯拉能源和EV工厂。中国要威胁马斯克需要发动网络攻击吗？
2,币安是骗子 是绝对犯罪集团 这个币安啊，它本来就是个骗子，它是个绝对犯罪集团，赵长鹏是替共产党干事的。你要谁要相信了，币安说它造多少币，我在两三年前就说过，“任何铸币的公司在网络上的政府叫做区块链政府，都告诉你，团队有权利造出币发行的币的3%-5%，甚至20%是合法的。
2,日本政府在1965年发现了有贫富分化的苗头，那个时候如果按照中国当时差不多水平的汇率计算相当于中国2001到2003年左右，于是日本开始出国民收入倍增计划，这是政府主导，不知道中国什么时候开始政府干预，或许是胡温末期，讲道理有点晚了，应该进入21世纪的时候就开始做
2,美国的增长势头将低于全球其他地区，不过，当人工智能叙事再次占据主导地位时，美国股市可能会恢复跑赢大盘。花旗称，考虑到中国科技行业的实力、政府对该行业的支持以及低廉的估值，即便在股市大涨之后，中国股市仍显得颇具吸引力；“ DeepSeek证明了中国技术处于西方技术前沿，甚至超越了西方技术，”
2,一个残酷虐待自己东部人民的纳粹政府，必须受到惩罚！腐败、邪恶的乌克兰政府早已沦为撒旦左派的洗钱机器，沦为围剿基督信仰的最后堡垒俄罗斯的炮灰！
2,懂点历史都知道 没有强政府百姓更惨，你们先别叫 两年内会被上到这一课的
2,川普是不是再人为的制造一场衰退，包括各种阴谋论，这个很难去验证。宏观上讲美国经济衰退确实再被各种数据验证，但我还是坚定认为美国经济并没有出现结构性的问题。那回到问题的核心，川普政府到底想干什么，想达成什么样的目的，是不是再下一盘大棋呢，首先我认为川普政府不是草台班子，尤其是财政部
2,深层政府 赚了 哈哈
2,为什么要掺乎人家的家事？这事不应该交给日本政府处理吗？难道网络声讨能解决问题？人都在日本，不需要像在中国一样还靠网络举报。还是大家一起吃一波流量，让当事双方成为道具。要相信制度，直接报警走法律途径。
2,《香港01》描述此事件为“史上最笨拙的政变”[274]。香港大学韩国研究课程高级讲师Paul Cha推测，尹选择于深夜颁布戒严令，是参考了韩国以往的军事政变。以往的政变大多在深夜发动，及后由政变军队控制街道与媒体，甚至主要政府建筑。惟由于是次事件中，国会议员在戒严令颁布后立即动员前往国会表决

2,日本农林水产省10日罕见拍卖了首批15万吨政府储备大米，以增加大米市场供应、抑制米价上涨。 日本共同社报道，这批大米在2023年至2024年收获，将交给满足特定条件的竞标企业，预期在3月底上市。

2,關於中国如何掌控媒體，有中国網軍帳號說，中国政府討厭自己的「黨媒之一鳳凰衛視」，但拿它沒辦法。 請不要被騙了。 連報導中国內部糞車裝水的記者都可以被消失（現在不知道出來了沒），還有什麼沒辦法？糞車可不是中共中央的事業。
2,川普的倒行逆施只能使美国的信仰丧失已尽，这次的股灾还只是开始，1929将回到美国，川普政府的伟大功绩。
2,看美国政府怎么编数据。
2,老邓估计也是从usaid拿钱的吧，不然为佬这么恨川马二人。川马削减政府开支鼓励制造业回流制止贪污浪费有什么不对吗？不用关税如何削减贸易赤字?如何能降低债务?许多人恨川马表面看很没由头。
2,【日媒：日本未能获得美方关税豁免承诺】据日本共同社报道，日本与美国举行了会谈，试图让日本免受特朗普政府拟对包括汽车和钢铁在内的进口商品加征的关税的影响。然而未能获得美方的任何承诺。 这意味着日本很可能被纳入定于3月12日生效的美国钢铁和铝关税加征范围。
2,李光耀感谢日本独裁的前提是货比货。76年5月他访华参观山西省昔阳县大寨，回国后就逐步解除戒严，因为他认为新加坡只要了解到当时中国的社会模式就会失去对共产主义的迷恋。至于二战荷兰两周投降、比利时四个月投降、法国维希政府、中国汪精卫政府等等等等，世界没完蛋的前提是二战反法西斯一方打赢了

2,弱智川粉连事实检查的能力都没有，张口就来，人家道歉个毛线了？川普政府公开羞辱小国首相，不该道歉？
2,两边政府都主张半岛是统一的国家，只是还没有合并。但是“国”的概念似乎有些狭隘了。对老百姓而言，政权问题并不重要，安居乐业才是我们想要的，不管谁执政，不管大陆还是台湾，只要让老百姓过上好日子，才是好政府。不能不提的是，什么政权都会有优势有弊端。其实欧盟也不错，以和为贵才是最重要的。
2,那還用說，當然是父母，我才能長大成人，就算是在我的國家，馬來西亞，要靠政府，除非是母豬爬上樹，大概率是還未成年就先夭折了。 先有家才有國！ ！ ！ 只有共產黨一堆瘋子才會認為爹親娘親不如(殺華人不眨眼的)毛主席(只濫殺華人的大魔頭)親，有國後才有家。
1,🤣🤣🤣特朗普政府全世界的敌人！马斯克跟着川普混，一天饿九顿！！🫢🫢马斯克财大气粗，可以这么玩，换成其他公司早就破产了！直接倒闭！🫢马斯克你知道世界人民的力量了吗？？？特朗普这个傻逼，你跟着他做坏事，能不破产吗？
2,按前朝政权的法律，是这样的。 关键在于，现在的执政党不是国民党，而是中国共产党，法律自然是要按照政权更迭后的政权建立的法律体系来施行。也就是说，中国共产党领导下的中国政府是唯一合法政府。
2,道理说不过就采用强盗手段，吓唬谁呢？这样不是更证明川普和马斯克做得对，要是换你们这些蠢货掌握政府权力，岂不是比共产党还共产党？可以无法无天，随意把别人财产没收只要你们高兴啦？
2,他俩去日本行政部门开具离婚证明就一个目的让李汀拿日本政府补助金！母子家庭手当、児童手当、生活保護、貧困補助金加起来二十几万呢，还有一大堆减免。你想他为什么来了俩月就离婚！
2,不是经济的问题，是美国政府和美元信誉出了问题。美国政府已经成了美股的负资产，正如中国政府之于中国股票。美国优先，美股优先收缩。
2,其实他老老实实把政府效率的事儿做好就行了，偏要跟着川普瞎嚷嚷，过于自大了。

2,而且可以确定的是，特朗普独裁地裁掉了大批官员，对美政府进行了大清洗，且出口了乌克兰5000亿援助军火，且枪击死亡率第一，且是英国毒血最大供应方，你说的全都是美国的真相啊，回旋镖这么抽自己主子的？
