2,The part that comes after the inflation 👀👀👀
0,Don’t forget these companies will blame whoever for “inflation” maybe drop your damn prices so the ceo doesn’t get his or her 7 figure bonus at the end of the year. In no universe is it right to charge 25 and 30 dollars for a f*cking pizza
2,Powell never said inflation was due to Biden’s policies. And the owl lady said inflation was transitory. Four plus years later it’s still happening.
2,So month on month inflation isn’t down in Argentina because the TV told you?

1,"Olusegun Obasanjo is likely Nigeria's best president, with strong GDP growth (5.6%) and anti-corruption efforts like founding the EFCC during 1999-2007. Umaru Ya'Adua had higher growth (6.8%) but a short tenure, while Goodluck Jonathan kept inflation low (10.35%). Obasanjo's"
0,"bad gun control what states/cities do they look at, expensive prices and cost of living it depends on what job you have and degree you went for, bad drug problems look at who we border and then look at the state of our borders which leads to high crime rates"
0,"I don't think it's the cost that primarilu results in the perception. It's the issues with petty crime, vagrancy, drugs,  regulations, poor governance, high taxes, etc. The cost of living just adds insult to injury."
1,"Things that bring birth rates down: (1) High taxes requiring both parents to work (2) High cost of living, making food shelter and clothing hard to sustain with multiple children (grew up with 6 siblings,  first hand view) (3) Self centered youth prioritizing their life"
0,LA and high cost of living metros need to apply a form-based code to suitable blocks. They can get their FAR by going up 4-6 stories.  Commercial on the bottom. Diverse building types comprising blocks.
0,"Ain’t nothing for free. They are taxed with a heavy hand.  The cost of living is also extremely high so your ratios are way off, kinda ironic you’re on a” fight the oligarch “ tour while being an oligarch"
1,"Milly raised an urgent matter. How can Gen z be happy when political class salaries increased. When we have many unemployed Dr's. How can they be happy when SHA is not working, when the education funding model not working. Cost of living high. Sit and talk over those issues."
0,"Are you kidding? What fool believes Liberal Media? Trudeau created this mess in Canada. High crime, hamas protestes, high cost of living, no jobs or housing. But hold up Trump did something. Liberals are so easly fooled."
0,"Are you saying they were low achievers or, that their rate of pay was too low or that our cost of living was too high"
0,"This election is not about Trump, it’s about the last 10 years or record high crime levels, record high immigration, cost of living, high taxes and opening up our natural resources so we aren’t dependent on any other country."
1,nope. hes for the people liberals have proven they are for themselves and the rich wealthy types. their history speaks for itself loud. high tax. high inflation. high cost of living . no growth. no investment and 60million more 3rdworld people coming in to crash our job/homes
0,bahaaa so you can let in 60million more 3rd world countries ? have higher cost of living way higher ? high Inflation? no growth? no investment ? higher taxes ? no good policy? I think the liberals history speaks very LOUD. #bluewave
1,"If Canada is a nation in decline, can you name one that isn't?  Canada's problems are the same ones that every modern, liberal, prosperous country are facing.  Inflation? Cost of living increases? High immigration?  Until 5 minutes ago, these were seen as symptoms of prosperity."
2,It’s more inflation/cost of living than high taxes. Look at the highest marginal tax rate in the US in the 20th century. Used to be much much higher.

1,"If low taxes come with high infant mortality, crumbling schools, and hospitals closing down… then the cost of living might be low, but the cost of dignity is far too high."

0,"Our healthcare system is so broken, what American is going to come here to work? Filthy hospitals. Lazy staff. Absolutely dismal economy. Cost of living is embarrassingly high for shitty substandard homes, food and clothing. Canadian dollar is tanking. Exactly why would they come"
0,"People are criticizing this, but it basically makes sense ""The opportunity cost of having a kid is high when living standards are high"" is an obviously true statement. Why have 10 kids and work manual labor until you drop dead, when you can have 1-2 and retire in luxury?"
2,It's been expensive for the last 4 years. Cities are expensive to live in anyway. Most cities have high taxes. Why don't the mayors do things that will make the cost of living affordable in their cities? They won't because they all have an agenda.
1,"Please complete your sentence; we had better elect Carney if we want continued high crime, high immigration, high cost of living, lack of housing, etc etc.  Fixed it for you, you're welcome."
2,Post I saw on Threads tells you all you need to know about the left. The irony is dripping from this.  Canadians can't afford to put more in their TFSA due to high cost of living under the Liberal govt policies. Canadians don't even have $416.00/month in disposable income.

0,"Our pipefitter plumber union contract only was 5 percent over 5 years, and no cost of living increases. We fell further behind with the inflation so high."
2,Progressives love sticking it to their enemies with high prices and lower cost of living
0,"I thought MAGA was primarily concerned with the cost of living. Attempting to take Greenland doesn’t solve high costs, but it sure ignites the hate, and fascism. It never was about high prices, or what’s best for all Americans. Hate is the driving force."
0,"I agree with this!I raised two children alone from 2000-to 2020 doing just this as you mention.But in Massachusetts the cost of living has gone up ⬆️ so much,It would be still difficult with one income unless that one income is extremely high.😔"

0,"For the economy and cost of Living in Nigeria 77k is not enough... Let alone saving from it. Nigeria as never be good and will never be good. When they are paying 33k cost of living is not as high as this, even with the increment of allowance it is still the same thing."
2,"The cost of living has gotten so high, I’m thinking about having a nap for dinner"
0,"Democrat/bureaucrat/governmental Corruption fraud, spending yourself into trillions of dollars of debt and Gross taxation have more to do with the high cost of living. How do these American/Canadian mayors explain the last four years of insane inflation in the housing market."
1,Why the cost of living so high? No fuel or expensive. Why if there any success? It is fabrication.
1,Man this has nothing to do with high cost of living 😏 the thing plays repeats all year around
0,Multichoice will still lose more customers because of greedeness and arrogance to its customers.  In this bad economy and high cost of living. Multichoice still increases prices of decoda and subscriptions. That is very unfair to poorest people who  like to be their customers
1,"lol. People don’t care about marginal rates of tax, they care about absolute tax. ie the cost you pay for living somewhere.  The maths don’t make sense for many high achievers anymore, when other countries in Europe and UAE offer them tax breaks"
1,Not really. Pretty much all American states are on some level of “pick your poison” to one degree or another. Where I live the cost of living is absurdly high but it isn’t as car centric as the rest of the country. You just gotta find what’s the most comfortable for you.
1,"He's right. Greenland has a very high cost of living, 44% tax rate on an average salary of $33k and less than mid ""free"" healthcare. So what has Denmark done for Greenland?"
1,"Because, again, of the high cost of living in this country, which is now higher because we are keeping cheaper goods of every kind heavily taxed, we will almost certainly have to subsidize the workers or the company or both, and to mandate price controls."
0,The cost of living in singapore is high af he had to do this shit lol
1,"The tariff level has to be sufficiently high to allow American manufacturers to employ the maximum number of Americans in manufacturing t-shirts. Because the cost of living in this country -- despite cheap goods -- is so high, that's gonna be pretty high."
0,The high cost of living is a result of greedy lawyers & crony capitalism. We need to bring back real capitalism & stop private equity & hedge funds from destroying small businesses
